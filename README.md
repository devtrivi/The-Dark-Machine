# The-Dark-Machine
Part 3 of the DrDarkstar series of projects> Audio integration. Check readme in DrDarkstar for more

In short:
1 Dr Darkstar is a simple JS game with HTML Canvas and amazins hand drawings by me, gatrivi.
2 Darkstar is a pixel rain effect meant both to compensate our current short staff of animators and as a reminiscence of how, in old school CRT monitor games like SNES, the archaic technology actually made everything look better. Here we will use todays superior technology to work in place of manpower by simulating old limited technology. 

Its a thing I learned from my drawing teacher Carlos Pedrazzini: use your limitations to your advantage.

3. Use built in HTML audio systems to take the users music as input and plug them into variables so the particles of the character, the strength, quality, even variety of his movements, the attack patterns of the enemies, the growth, color and behaviour of the environment will change according to users mood through music.

The beginning, as life, will be deceptively simple.
